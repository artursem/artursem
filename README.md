Frontend enthusiast focused on building responsive apps with mobile-first approach. Motivated about developing new skills and constantly expanding my tech stack. Solid knowledge of HTML and CSS as well as modern JavaScript and basic browser APIs. Comfortable building visually appealing interfaces with React and managing state with Redux. Delivering new features with confidence thanks to tests written with Jest, react-testing-library and Cypress. Curious about shaping the way users interact with applications.
